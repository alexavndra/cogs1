# COGS 1 WEBSITE
**NOT AN OFFICIAL COGS 1 COURSE WEBSITE**

Created by Alexandra Hernandez, COGS 1 Instructional Assistant

## Goal of Website
Providing extra navigational help for COGS 1 to students. Website includes discussion slides (from sections A03-A04), section assignments, location of sections (at UC San Diego), links to class resources, contact information to TAs/IAs/Professor, and descriptions of class and sections. 

## Website Processing
This website was made with sole **HTML** and **CSS**, along with **Figma** for concept design.
In the process of adding JavaScript for animation/viewport accessibility.
Overall website is still a WIP, and is continuously updated on github.com to reflect section changes, discussion slide additions, and overall viewport flexibility/design.

## About Me
I'm a second year Cognitive Sciences major specializing in Machine Learning and Neural Computation, with a minor in Computer Sciences. As mentioned, I'm a COGS 1 Instructional Assistant, but I currently am also employed by UC San Diego's **Qualcomm Institute**.

My previous works include my own [portfolio](https://alexavndra.github.io), Astrologify, and ReminderApp. Though I'm still in the process of uploading Astrologify and ReminderApp to my GitHub (they're old and code is no longer updated), you can check out the code of my portfolio via my GitHub.
